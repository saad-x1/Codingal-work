            <h1>Football</h1> is a team sport played between
            two teams of <mark>eleven players</mark> on a rectangular field
            with a goal at each end. The objective is to score by getting
            the <pre>ball</pre> into the opposing team's goal, using any part
            of the body except the <code>hands and arms</code> (except for
            the goalkeeper). The team with the most goals at the end of the
            match wins, while the <abbr>defending team</abbr> tries to
            prevent this and <blockquote>stop</blockquote> the ball from
            entering their goal.
